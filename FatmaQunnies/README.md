The code is structured into independent modules, which improves clarity and maintainability. By dividing the project into separate files—task.py, urgent_task.py, utils.py, and task_manager.py—each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the task management system. This modular approach helps in managing and troubleshooting the code efficiently.

Input Handling and Validation:
The application includes robust input validation functions such as validate_date, validate_status, and validate_priority. These functions ensure that users provide correct information. 

If the input is incorrect, the user is prompted to re-enter the data, which minimizes errors and ensures the stability of the application.

Object-Oriented Programming Principles:
The project utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles effectively. The UrgentTask class inherits from the Task class , demonstrating the use of inheritance. This design promotes code reuse and makes the system more adaptable and easier to extend in the future.
