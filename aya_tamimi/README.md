# Task Manager Console Application

The Task Manager Console Application is a Python-based tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently through a command-line interface. 

## Features

- **Add Task**: You can add new tasks by entering details like title, description, due date, and status. If a task is urgent, you can set its priority too.
- **View Tasks**: See all your tasks in one place, with urgent tasks shown separately to help you prioritize.
- **Update Task**: Change the details of any task—just pick the one you want to update.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Search by Status**: Filter tasks by their status (e.g., InProgress, Completed) to focus on what’s important.
- **Save Your Work**: Tasks are saved in a JSON file, so they’ll be there the next time you run the app.
